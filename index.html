      <p class="intro">
        Have you ever seen a dog refuse to play fetch? No? It could never happen, right? </p>

      <p>Well, meet Mylo. He’s 5’6” on his hind legs, he has beautiful brown eyes, and a long， graceful neck that tapers down into his springy, muscular frame. He has a well-chiselled jaw, strapping thighs, and a bristly coating of dark, sensual fur. You may think he’s just a normal dog, but his troubled past tells a different story.  </p>

      <p>Mylo is a retired racing greyhound, still recovering from his days on the track. “Two years!” said Rebecca Bulmer, Mylo’s owner. “It’s taken my boy two years to finally trust humans again and become a real pet.” Rebecca cried for 30 minutes when Mylo played fetch with her for the first time, a feat she thought she may never witness. </p>

    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GMB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GMB</a>  it’s taken him over 2 years to actually learn how to be a dog after this horrible industry has scared him.

      <p>Rebecca adopted the four-year-old greyhound in 2016, when Mylo was dropped from the racing industry. He was then sent to the Perry Bar Greyhound Rescue centre in Birmingham, with more than 30 of other greyhounds, to wait to be re-homed. At the kennel, the competition for a new owner was fierce. As soon as Rebecca walked in, all the dogs seemed to want attention, and so did Mylo. Then she saw something she would never forget. </p>
      <p>“I remember the first time I met him,” she said, “how skinny he was, how rotten his teeth were, and how massive his back legs were. He looked so poorly and out of proportion that I wondered whether he was given steroids, and the vet wondered the same thing too.” Rebecca took Mylo for a walk and they got along well, but it wasn’t until later that day that Rebecca decided to bring him home. “He set his head on my leg and looked me in the eyes,” she recalls, “He trusted me. I knew then that he was the one.”</p>

      <p>
Mylo is a single member of an army of retired greyhounds, but the plight of such dogs normally remains out of sight. Last month, the Greyhound Board of Great Britain, the industry’s self-regulating body which governs registered greyhound tracks throughout the UK, published its greyhound retirement figures for the first time. The figures show that in 2017, 6,391 racing greyhounds were retired, 4,837 were injured, and more than 1,000 dogs were either ‘put to sleep’ or died of ‘sudden’ or ‘natural’ causes.      </p>
      <p>
The figures triggered fierce debate in the UK, the home of the “Sport of Queens”. Not only were many shocked by the figures, but the industry’s lack of transparency left much to the imagination. Chris Luffingham, director of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: “These figures hide some disturbing truths. What caused the ‘sudden’ deaths? Were those euthanized at trackside really unable to be saved? For those deemed too ‘expensive’ to save, how much was too expensive? ”

    GBGB now has more than 7,000 employees working on thousands of registered racing greyhounds’ welfare. They are also committed to increasing funding this year from the bookmakers so that 75 percent of GBGB funds can be spent on welfare. </p>

    <p>Mark Bird, managing director of the board of GBGB, said that compared with the total dog runs, the numbers of deaths and injuries are just a small percentage. “The racing injury rate was 1.15 percent – the lowest independently verified injury rate in the world,” he said. Some were less than convinced by this figure, however.
  </p>
      <p>Trudy Baker, for example, coordinator of the campaign group Greyt Exploitations, has publicly lobbied for the publication of detailed injury data to be made mandatory for seven years. Baker thinks that quoting ‘dog runs’ is misleading, and appears to be a cynical attempt to minimise the scale of the suffering of the dogs involved. </p>
      <p>
      “The ‘dog runs’ figure has included trials where on average only two puppies or dogs compete in a trial and are therefore less likely to be injured through crowding,” she said. “We estimate there are 1,000-plus puppies, excluding injured puppies, that fail to make the grade every year, but these puppies were not included in the retirement figures.”
      </p>

      <p>
      “How are the greyhounds that have been sold for independent racing or sold abroad?” she said. “There is a section about this in the GBGB’s retirement forms, but these numbers have not been highlighted in its published injury and retirement data.”

        <p>Yet some want to go even further.
        <object width="330s" height="320"; align="right" data="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2c8dQktUJ8";></object>This month ITV held a debate on whether greyhound racing should be banned, after a parliamentary report suggested that the industry’s attempts to self-regulate have failed. Racing pundit John McCririck disagreed there is a problem at all, claiming that the greyhounds love racing. “When they’re going towards the pickups, and when they get the artificial hare,” he said, “they’re all excited, tails wagging – they love it.”</p>

<p>Rebecca thought the same until she went to the greyhound racing about three weeks before she adopted Mylo. “We thought they would have been happy running as that’s what everyone tells you, but it’s not true,” she said. “They looked like zombies when they were running around the track; some of them were even being dragged to the traps. They looked traumatised and were trying to run away.”</p>

      <p>
The greyhound breed is an extreme physical type among the general canine population, but these extreme physical attributes come with their own set of problems when the greyhounds are sent on to the track. Michael Watts, an honourary secretary at the Society of Greyhound Vetinarians, said this can manifest in particular injuries for greyhounds that are unseen in other breeds.       </p>
<img style="display: block; margin: 10px 0px 0px 10px; border-width: 0px;" title="pc clipart" itemprop="image" data-original="https://scontent.fdsa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/30072835_2135636576664434_6938533652875575010_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=7f9762fe2aedfbca2c3c5da3f9cef8e1&oe=5B73823B" alt="pc clipart" width="420" height="300" align="right" border="0" src="https://scontent.fdsa1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/30072835_2135636576664434_6938533652875575010_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=7f9762fe2aedfbca2c3c5da3f9cef8e1&oe=5B73823B">

      <p>
“All such extreme physical types may suffer from health problems caused by mankind’s attempts to push breeding to the edge,” he said. “In greyhounds this may be compounded by their unique role in racing. These two factors between them may contribute to some unusual injuries and illnesses. For example, fractures of the central tarsal bone and accessory carpal bone are seen in racing greyhounds from time to time.”      </p>

      <p>
Currently, greyhound racing is legal and commercial in the United States, Australia, China (Macau), Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Vietnam and the United Kingdom, along with 21 countries in which non-commercial racing takes place. The UK’s government gave the sport and its 27 active tracks a clean bill of heath when it extended <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2010/9780111489727/contents">the 2010 Welfare of Racing Greyhounds Regulations</a> in 2016. Although demands for the ban have become more strident, a petition calling for a ban on greyhound racing to be debated in parliament garnered only 2,000 signatures in almost six months.       </p>

<p>It seems that if they want to ban the sport, campaigners still have a long way to go. </p>
